# height-weight-simple-linear-regression
This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model using scikit-learn to predict weight from height. It’s a beginner-friendly example of applying supervised machine learning to real-world data.

##  Project Overview

* Explores the relationship between **Height** and **Weight**.
* Uses **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to visualize trends.
* Implements a **Linear Regression model** to fit the data.
* Evaluates model performance with metrics like **R² score** and visual plots.

## Files in Repository

* `height-weight.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow (EDA, model training, evaluation).
* `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).
* *(Optional)* If you have datasets, include them or link to them.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/height-weight-regression.git
   cd height-weight-regression
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook height-weight.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells step by step to explore the dataset, train the model, and see predictions.

##  Results

* The regression line clearly shows the positive correlation between height and weight.
* The model achieves a good fit for this dataset, demonstrating how linear regression works on simple numeric data.

---

## Future Improvements

* Experiment with larger datasets.
* Build a small web app (using **Streamlit** or **Flask**) to predict weight from height interactively.
